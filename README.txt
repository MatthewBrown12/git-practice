Hi GitHub, this year I am partaking in the Durham University Quant Fund. This is a space where I get to learn how to apply mathematics and programming to financial markets through lectures, workshops and competitions. 

I am really looking forward to this opportunity to utilise my skills to learn more about and potentially pursue a career in Quantitative Finance.
